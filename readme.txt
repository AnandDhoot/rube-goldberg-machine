We are using three latedays in the submission of this assignment/project.

First extract contents of the submitted the tar.gz file. (I assume you have already done this because you are reading this file)
To install the distributable, do "make install".
To compile, build the executable, generate report, presentation and documentation, do "make".
To make a distributable, do "make distclean".

The HTML project report can be reached at www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ananddhoot/project.html.
This includes the video of the simulation, our project report - a brief description of the project.

Tools used - 
BASH Scripting - We made many several scripts for testing purposes. One of them is attched with this submission, named as "a.sh". This script runs "make" and reruns the executable again and again after a fixed period of time. This was done to check whether the small changes we make so as to find the perfect location of all elements is correct. 
Libraries - On doing "make exelib", the shared/static library is also generated, as done in class, and the executable is built using those libraries.
Git - In the beginning of the project, we were maintaining a Git repo, which was submitted during the midsem evaluation. However, later, all three of us started coding simultaneously on different parts of the machine. This resulted in completely inablility to maintain a repo and integration of the code was much easier.
